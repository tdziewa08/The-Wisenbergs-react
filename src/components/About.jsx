            <h2>Our Mission : Win One</h2>
            <p className="mission">The Wisenbergs formed in Medford, NJ on March XXth 2024. What started as an experimental leisure activity has now bolossomed into a weekly hang for all of our members. At least once per week we, The Wisenbergs, descend upon a New Jersey brewery in hopes to take home the win. But these breweries got handz and at the current time we are still in search of that elusive dub. Our team's knowledge is diverse and each of our additional members bring something new to the table. We hope to meet and compete against you all sometime down the road....the KING's road.</p>
